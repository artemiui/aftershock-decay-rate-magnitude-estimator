<h1>Aftershock Frequency and Magnitude Prediction of Philippine Earthquakes Using Omori’s Law and Bath’s Law</h1>
Machine learning-based parameter estimation algorithm of aftershock frequencies through Omori's Law by the curve fit function in SciPy and the 
integration of Bath's Law to each derived mainshocks as primary products of this project.  
<br>

<br>
In particular, our project is centered around developing a static predictive model of aftershock magnitude and frequency using the principles of Omori's Law and Bath's 
Law in integration with preprocessed, algorithmically identified mainshocks and aftershocks derived from seismic event data 
within the <a href="http://earthquake.science.upd.edu.ph/significant-eqs">UPRI Citizen Science Seismic Network (CS-UPRI)</a></li> and 
<a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/">USGS Earthquake Hazards Program (USGS)</a></li> datasets.
