<h2>Project description</h2>
Simultaneous identification of the k, c, and p parameters in Omori's Law through the curve fit function in SciPy and the integration of Bath's Law to each derived mainshocks as primary products of this project.  In particular, our study aims to develop a static predictive model of aftershock magnitude and frequency using the principles of Omori's Law and Bath's Law in integration with preprocessed, algorithmically identified mainshocks and aftershocks derived from seismic event data within the UPRI Citizen Science Seismic Network (CS-UPRI) and USGS Earthquake Hazards Program (USGS) datasets.
