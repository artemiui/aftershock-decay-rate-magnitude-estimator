<h2>Project description</h2>
Simultaneous identification of the k, c, and p parameters in Omori's Law through the curve fit function in SciPy and the integration of Bath's Law to each mainshock assigned values of the dataset will be done as preliminaries to building a data frame that can then be compared with actual aftershock data to validate its accuracy and validity as a model through data visualization.
