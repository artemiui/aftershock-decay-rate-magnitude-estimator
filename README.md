With emerging statistical tools and methodologies in geophysics, aftershock prediction is of particular interest in the Philippine tectonic setting notably as preliminary bases of mitigating disaster risk and upholding resilience. This study aims to develop a static predictive model of aftershock magnitude and frequency using the principles of Omori's Law and Bath's Law in integration with preprocessed, algorithmically identified mainshocks and aftershocks derived from seismic event data.

Simultaneous identification of the k, c, and p parameters in Omori's Law through the curve fit function in SciPy and the integration of Bath's Law to each mainshock assigned values of the dataset will be done as preliminaries to building a data frame that can then be compared with actual aftershock data to validate its accuracy and validity as a model through data visualization.
